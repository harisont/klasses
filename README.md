# klasses

 A collection of code snippets used for my very first Kotlin tutorials. 
 All of the examples (comments & variable names) are in Italian as I'm currently teaching Kotlin in Italian.
 
 The point of this repo is to:
 
 - make these snippets available to the person I am teaching to after the classes
 - make my life easier if I ever have to teach the same stuffa a second time
 - possibly transform these snippets into more structured written or video tutorial, as there are not many resources to learn Kotlin without already knowing Java
